        text: Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity as an action to
          create a small and magically concentrated potion called a healing
          draft. The potion appears in a small glass bottle in your free hand or
          at your feet (your choice), and is a deep blue color with flecks of
          gold. A creature that uses a bonus action to drink this potion regains
          a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your cleric level. The bottle
          and any undrunk healing draft turns to dust and is lost when you
          finish a short or long rest.
