      Starting at 14th level, your manipulation of the light around you becomes
      masterful. While light-shifted, your Flickering Aura produces sunlight.
      While dark-shifted, your aura produces magical darkness.


      If any of this aura's area overlaps with an area of light or darkness created by a spell equal to or lower than the level of your highest available spell slot, the spell that created the light or darkness is dispelled.
