          When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic weapon, that creature
          takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or
          fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
          saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has
          the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.


          **Light.** While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

You will need to keep it equipped and attuned on DnDB, but please customise the name so that it uses this attack and not the one from there
