      As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and choose a creature you can see (including yourself) within 30 feet.

      The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your cleric level.

      While a creature has temporary hit points granted by this feature, it has **resistance to spell damage** and **advantage on saving throws against spells**.

      Remaining temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.
