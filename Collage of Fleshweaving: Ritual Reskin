          **Bull’s Buns.** The target has advantage on Strength checks, and counts
          as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the
          weight it can push, drag, or lift.

          **Cactus Skin.** The target is covered in razor-sharp spikes. At the end of each of the target’s turns, each creature grappling it must make a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes piercing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die and releases the target from its grapple. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to release the target.

          **Cat’s Paws.** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.

          **Fish Form.** The target can breathe underwater and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.

          **Owl’s Sight.** The target has advantage on Wisdom checks and initiative rolls.

          **Rhino’s Hide.** The target has advantage on Constitution checks and gains temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), which are lost when the effect ends.
