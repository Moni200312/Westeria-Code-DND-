          You can use a bonus action and spend 3 maneuver points to channel the
          charging bull, moving up to your speed. While moving this way, you can
          move through the space of creatures of your size or smaller, but you
          must end your movement in an unoccupied space.


          Each creature whose space you moved through must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + {{strengthMod}}.
