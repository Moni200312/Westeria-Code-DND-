          You can spend an action and 5 maneuver points to put yourself into a deep
          and restful sleep for the next 10 minutes. During this time you have
          resistance to all damage except psychic and, when you take damage, you
          can choose to remain asleep or wake up. If you sleep for the entire 10
          minutes, you gain the benefits of having completed a short rest,
          immediately end any poison affecting you, and lose one level of
          exhaustion.


          At the end of this sleep, you can spend and roll any number of Hit Die, adding your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die rolled, gaining temporary hit points equal to the total.
