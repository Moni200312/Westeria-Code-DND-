      At 6th level, you gain the ability to feast on the vitality of your foes
      while you are in your Form of the Beast. Once per turn, when you hit a
      creature with your bite attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra
      3d6 points of necrotic damage. You regain a number of hit points equal to
      half the total damage dealt with this attack.


      Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you score a critical hit with a bite or claw attack or until you finish a short or long rest.


      At 10th level, the extra necrotic damage provided by this feature increases to 5d6.


      -# ***To heal the total damage dealt of the bite, run the (Heal) action and add*** `-d` ***with the overall damage.***
