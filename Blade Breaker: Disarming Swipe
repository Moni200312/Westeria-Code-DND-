        text: You can target your foeâ€™s weapon instead of their body. When you hit with
          a melee attack, you can spend 2 maneuver points and deal no damage
          with that attack. Instead, the target must succeed on a Strength or
          Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be disarmed. A disarmed
          creature drops any weapons or shields it is holding.
