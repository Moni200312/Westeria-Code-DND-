        You can deal bonus force damage when you hit with a weapon attack.

        Choose the appropriate damage amount: - 1d8 (normal) - 2d8 (if the target is concentrating or you're level 14) - 3d8 (if the target is concentrating AND you're level 14)

        If the target fails their concentration saving throw, gain temporary HP equal to the force damage dealt.

        You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
