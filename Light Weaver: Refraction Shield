    text: At 6th level, you can manipulate the light around you for protection. As a
      bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically create a shield
      of light. While the shield is in place, whenever a creature within 5 feet
      of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield flashes with searing
      energy, and the attacker takes 2d8 radiant damage if you are light-shifted
      or 2d8 necrotic damage if you are dark-shifted. The shield disappears if
      you fall unconscious or after 10 minutes.
