          As an action, you can spend 3 maneuver points and imbue your weapon with
          magic and declare a single creature. For the next 8 hours, that weapon
          is magical and if it deals damage to the declared creature, it also
          reduces the targetâ€™s maximum hit points by same amount. This reduction
          lasts until the target finishes a long rest.


          If the declared creature dies from damage dealt by the imbued weapon, it cannot be returned to life by magic for as long as the weapon is touching the creature.
