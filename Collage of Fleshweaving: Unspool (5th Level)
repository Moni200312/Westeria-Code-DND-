        text: As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move
          the weapon up to 20 feet and force one creature within 5 feet of the
          weapon to make a Strength saving throw against your bard spell save
          DC. On a failure, magical threads wrap around the creature, which is
          restrained for 1 minute. The target can use its action to repeat the
          saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
