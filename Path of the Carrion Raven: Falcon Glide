          When you fall, you can use your reaction and spend 1 maneuver point to
          slow your fall to 60 feet per round for 1 minute. If you land before
          this time elapses, you take no falling damage.


          In addition, as a bonus action on each of your turns for the duration of this maneuver, you can spend 1 additional maneuver point to gain a fly speed of 30 feet until the end of the turn.
