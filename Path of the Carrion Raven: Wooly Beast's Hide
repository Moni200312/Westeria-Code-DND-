        text: When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 or
          more maneuver points to use the resilient parts of your body to shield
          your vulnerabilities from harmful damage. When you use this maneuver,
          roll 1d6 for every 2 points you spend to use this maneuver and reduce
          the damage from an attack by the result. After taking any remaining
          damage, you also gain temporary hit points equal to the result of the
          roll.
