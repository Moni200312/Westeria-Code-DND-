        text: You can use a bonus action and spend 2 maneuver points to emit a
          terrifying howl. Two creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you
          must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
          frightened until the start of your next turn. Each time the frightened
          creature takes damage from weapon attacks, they take an additional 1d6
          psychic damage.
