      Starting at 3rd level, you can perform a special ritual to siphon the
      power of shadow and bind it to yourself. You can conduct this ritual
      during a long rest. Performing the ritual requires time spent meditating
      in nonmagical darkness for at least 1 hour. At the end of the ritual, you
      choose one of the following effects, which lasts for 24 hours or until you
      perform the ritual again:

          When you are in dim light or darkness, as part of your move, you can teleport up to half your speed to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first Dexterity (Stealth) check you make before the end of your turn.
          When you are in dim light or darkness, if you move at least half your speed, you benefit from a perpetual half cover until the start of your next turn: +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
          When you hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal additional cold damage equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

      2 = teleport

      1 = half-cover

      0 = cold damage
