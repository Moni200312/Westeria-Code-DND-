      At 17th level, you can wrap your foes in debilitating shadow. When you
      deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force them to make a
      Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity
      modifier). If the save fails, the target is restrained for 1 minute. The
      restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


      Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
