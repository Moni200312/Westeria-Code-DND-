          When you make a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic
          Inspiration, adding your Bardic Inspiration die to the attack or
          damage roll. When you do this, you gain the benefits of your chosen
          Fighting Style for 10 minutes.


          At 6th level, you learn how to use your stance to chain your attacks together in a deadly combination. Once, while your Fighting Style is active, you may attack twice, instead of once, when taking the Attack action on your turn.


          At 14th level you have learned to shore up any weaknesses in your stance. You gain +1 to your AC for the effectâ€™s duration.
