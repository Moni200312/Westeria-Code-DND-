    text: When a creature within 5 ft. of you that you can see hits you with an
      attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Con
      saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, the
      creature takes 1d12 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its
      next turn. On a successful one, it takes half as much poison damage and
      isn't poisoned. You can use this feature your Wisdom Mod times, per long
      rest.
