          You can use an action and spend 5 maneuver points to attempt to sunder
          your enemy with excessive force. When you do, a creature within your
          reach must succeed on a Strength saving throw. If the creature is
          currently grappled by you, it has disadvantage on this saving throw.


          On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 6d10 force damage. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage. If damage from this maneuver reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies as you rip it apart.
