                        While light-shifted you can use an action to emit an aura of bright light
                        in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. While
                        the aura persists, you can use a bonus action to expand
                        or reduce its radius of bright light by 5 feet, to a
                        maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet.


                        `!map -under# circle,17,b,{targ} -t "{{caster.name}}"`


                        (Note, change your number to radius+2, so if you extend to 20ft, it is 22. If you reduce to 10ft, it is 12. This is to take your token size into consideration.)

      Starting at 1st level, you can choose whether your magic is light-shifted
      or dark-shifted. You can change your choice at the end of a long rest.


      While light-shifted you can use an action to emit an aura of bright light in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. While the aura persists, you can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright light by 5 feet, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet.


      While dark-shifted you gain the same ability, but you project an aura of nonmagical darkness.


      You may subtract or add 1 to the cc "Flickering Aura" every long rest in order to denote Light (1 cc) or Dark (0 cc)
