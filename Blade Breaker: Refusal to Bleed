          As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 maneuver point to roll
          a d10. Add your fighter level to the number rolled and reduce the
          damage by that total.


          If the triggering damage is from an attack, you can spend 3 additional maneuver points to reduce all damage from the creature that attacked you by the same total until the start of your next turn.
