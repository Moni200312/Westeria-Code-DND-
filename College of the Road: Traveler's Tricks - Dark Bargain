      When you select this option, choose an Eldritch Invocation from the
      Warlock’s list of class features for which you meet the prerequisites. You
      can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to gain the benefits of this
      Dark Invocation for 10 minutes. Doing this requires you to roll your
      Bardic Inspiration die and take an amount of necrotic damage equal to the
      roll.


      At 14th level, your pact with the warlock unlocks frightening new power. When you reach 14th level, choose a single spell of 7th level or lower from the warlock’s spell list. You may cast the spell once during this effect without expending any spell slots, although you must cast it at the level of your highest spell slot. In exchange, the spell deals additional necrotic damage to you equal to twice the level at which it was cast.
