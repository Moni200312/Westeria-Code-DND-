          When you take the attack action, you can expend one use of your Bardic
          Inspiration to quickly execute two unarmed strikes against one or more
          creatures you could target. You may use Dexterity instead of Strength
          for the attack and damage rolls of these unarmed strikes. The damage
          die used for these unarmed strikes is the same as your Bardic
          Inspiration die.


          At 6th level, you have finally mastered the “weave” portion of your technique. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity this turn.


          At 14th level, your practice has paid off, granting you the use of a slightly ki-infused attack. When you hit with one of these attacks you may attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
