    text: You say a special prayer before eating a meal to enchant it and other food
      of your choice within 30 ft. of you with unique protections. A creature
      that eats this enchanted food over the next 10 minutes gains 2d6 + 10
      temporary HP, is immune to being charmed, and can't be put to sleep by
      magic. These benefits last for 8 hours and don't set in until these 10
      minutes are over. You and up to six other willing creatures of your choice
      gain these benefits by partaking in the meal. Once you use this feature,
      you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
