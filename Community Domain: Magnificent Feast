    text: Starting at 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to conjure a
      magical feast for the rough road ahead. By spending 10 minutes, you may
      create a number of delicious, well-prepared, yet simple food items equal
      to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). These food items will last up to 8
      hours or until the end of a rest, and will never spoil. Eating food
      created in this way takes an action, providing whomever eats it with
      healing equal to 2d4 + your cleric level, and can remove either the
      frightened or poisoned condition from that creature (chosen by the
      creature when consumed).
