        text: You can use an action and spend 8 maneuver points to cast polymorph
          targeting only yourself without providing material components.
          However, you can only transform into a beast with a CR of half your
          level or lower, and you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
          scores. Constitution is your spellcasting ability when you cast the
          spell in this way.
