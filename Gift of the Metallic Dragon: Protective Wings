        text: You can manifest protective wings that can shield you or others. When you
          or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an
          attack roll, you can use your reaction to manifest spectral wings from
          your back for a moment. You grant a bonus to the target's AC equal to
          your proficiency bonus against that attack roll, potentially causing
          it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your
          proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a
          long rest.
