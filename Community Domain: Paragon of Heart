      Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to instill a
      feeling of vigilant protection in you and your allies. You grant yourself
      and a number of allies, up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), a boon
      from your deity. Allies must be able to see you and be within 30 feet to
      receive the boon. Once per round, a creature benefitting from this boon
      can roll a d6, adding the result to a skill check, saving throw, or attack
      roll. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom
      modifier (minimum of 1 round). A creature can only benefit from this
      effect if it can see at least one of its allies. 


      At 17th level, your Community Watch grants an additional d6 to each affected ally. It also grants immunity to fear for the duration of the effect. Additionally, your Magnificent Feast produces twice as many foodstuffs, each of which can, when consumed, remove a single curse or disease affecting the target (including attunement to a cursed item)
