          When you make an attack with a melee weapon that has either the heavy,
          two-handed, or versatile quality, you can expend one use of your
          Bardic Inspiration to gain advantage on the attack. Add the number you
          roll on your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier to the
          attack’s damage roll. Attacks made against you this round have
          advantage.


          At 6th level you have learned, through practice, how to push your offense even further. You may impose a -5 penalty to this attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.


          At 14th level, your experience has taught you how to really go all in. If you have not moved this turn, you may voluntarily reduce your speed to 0 until your next turn to resolve this attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, making a separate attack roll for each target.
