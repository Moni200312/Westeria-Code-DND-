                              A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
                               Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    text: Beginning at 18th level, your spell energy overwhelms your target's
      perceptions. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to empower your
      Flickering Aura. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if
      you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts
      its turn within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
      or be blinded until the aura ends.
