        When you or friendly creatures finish a short rest and spend one or more
        Hit Dice to regain hit points, each of those creatures may re-roll one
        of the dice spent and choose the higher result.

        This effect only applies once per creature per short rest.

        You also gain proficiency with Cookâ€™s Utensils.

        This feature reflects your ability to conjure a magical hearth and prepare nourishing meals during rests.
