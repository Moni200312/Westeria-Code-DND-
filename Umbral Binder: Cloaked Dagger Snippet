!snippet cloaked -f "At 9th level, shadows hide your every strike. You gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 30 feet, are in dim light or darkness, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you."
