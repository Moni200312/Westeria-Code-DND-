              Instead, the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed
              save, one of their weapons is damaged. A damaged weapon deals half
              as much damage. If this maneuver is used on a damaged weapon, that
              weapon is destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable. This maneuver
              has no effect on natural or magical weapons.
